# Disabe-ADUserReport
Script designed to disable users in AD from a .csv, and generate a HTML report of the results.

Schema for the .csv is:
SAMAccountName
SAMAccountnames

Note: input and output is generic, edit it to suit your environment before using.

There's also a version which exports to a CSV instead, if that's preferred.
